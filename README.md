# CS-5244-web-dev-descriptions

This project involved the following tech stack:


MySQL

Tomcat

Java

Node.js

Vue

CSS/HTML


This project was designed and implemented during an 8 week course in summer 2021. 
Front end was designed using flexbox and CSS/HTML from scratch, rather than using shortcut plugins like Vuetify. 
Functionality is demonstrated in the "KnudsenBooks Project Demo" video.

Due to Virginia Tech Honor Code considerations, the code is unavailable in a public repository. Requests for the code will be considered on an individual basis.
