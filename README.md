# CS-5244-web-dev-descriptions

This project involved the following tech stack:

> MySQL
> Tomcat
> Java
> Node.js
> Vue
> CSS/HTML

This project was designed and implemented during an 8 week course in summer 2021. 
Front end was designed using flexbox and CSS/HTML from scratch, rather than using shortcut plugins like Vuetify. 
Functionality is demonstrated in the "KnudsenBooks Project Demo" video.
